# Clinical-Trials-Scrapping

This repository contains a script developed to retrieve and systematically process clinical trial data from the ClinicalTrials.gov API. Core functionalities include interfacing with the API, applying keyword-based classification for data categorization, and executing comprehensive data preprocessing workflows.

The script is designed for automated deployment within an Azure environment, configured to execute on the first day of each month at 8:00 AM.
